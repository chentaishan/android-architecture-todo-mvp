Demo|Content
---|---
[todo-mvp](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp/) | Basic Model-View-Presenter architecture. This sample is the base for many of the variants. It showcases a simple implementation of the Model-View-Presenter pattern with no architectural frameworks. It uses manual dependency injection to provide a repository with local and remote data sources. Asynchronous tasks are handled with callbacks.
[todo-mvp-clean](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp-clean/) | Based on todo-mvp, uses concepts from Clean Architecture.It's based on the MVP sample, adding a domain layer between the presentation layer and repositories, splitting the app in three layers.

I just pulled the most basic framework out,I use to learn mvp architecture. It is a simple demo.
